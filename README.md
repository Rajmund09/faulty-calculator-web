A fun **Faulty Calculator** web app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Most of the time it gives the correct result, but sometimes it intentionally gives a wrong answer — just for fun 😄.

- Random faulty logic (10% chance)

- Beginner-friendly JavaScript logic

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

## ⚙️ How It Works
